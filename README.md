# RoboStrixx
This repository contains the project of Team Binary#404 for the Equinox Hackathon'21 organized by RoboVitics powered by MLH.
The team members are Dibyanshu Mohanty, Himanshu Shah, Preetish Biswal, Mayank Sharma.

#ROBOSTRIXX : Complete surveillance solutions for your property in your mobile phones while sitting at the comfort of your couch.

#MOTIVE : In the current circumstances of Covid-19 pandemic, taking care of independent houses and farmhouses is a serious issue for most house owners. When we look into the future, post Covid times, the demand for automated security and surveillance will continue to increase as most of the things will shift to online. Thus RoboStrixx would play a key role in solving your security problems.

#WHY ROBOSTRIXX: Robostrixx comes into play with its state of the art technology backed with multiple sensors providing an entire report of your property, available to you in your mobile phone.It's on duty, 24*7 having flame sensors to sense fire, obstacle, shock, tilt sensors and path tracking for automated seamless operations, 360 degree rotating camera giving you an entire watch on the property. All the data will be available on the user dashboard which will be updated in real-time. The path of the robot needs to be set on installation ( most probably along the boundaries of the property) and it will continue to trace the path everyday.

#TECH STACK USED : HTML5, CSS3, Django REST framework, Arduino, Node MCU, ThingSpeak Cloud Serices, postgreSQL.

Due to lockdown in many states , it was difficult for us to arrange a 360 degree camera module along with high torque motors. But out of the same we learnt how to maximize the output from limited time and resources.

We have also enabled booking demo for our test prototypeand as soon as an user books a demo on our website , Our developers would recieve a mail and will be notified and can contact them anytime soon.

#PROTOTYPE OF ROBOSTRIXX
The prototype model is based on a toy car chassis loaded with an exhaustive list of sensors such as IR sensor, flame sensor, tilt sensor, shock sensor , tracking module, temp and humidity sensor.
The development boards used are Arduino and NodeMCU.
It is completely automated, loaded with obstacle, tilt and shock sensors so every time a obstacle/uneven path is detected the robot can adjust its motion accordingly and overcome the obstacle.
The data from the sensors is first received at ThinkSpeak Cloud, and the same is made accessible to the userâ€™s website using the API.
If used for industrial purpose, further automation is possible with the respective sensors required as per the place of deployment.
The data received from the sensors can be further used for analysis in the Thingspeak cloud.

#FUTURE SCOPE:
We will use Industrial state of art sensors and high torque motors to develop and deploy robots that have highly specified space of work eg. Industry, Farmhouse etc.
During the further development of this project, we also aim to launch more personalized feature where you can control the bot while comforting on your couch.
